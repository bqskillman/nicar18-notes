##### Description

Too often, data journalism falls into the trap of preaching to the converted — informing elite, liberal, white audiences on issues they already understand pretty well. This panel will look at three case studies of how journalists harnessed data, innovative storytelling and audience engagement to expose injustices faced by marginalized communities and bring those communities into the policy debate. 

## Notes

How can we produce journalism about marginalized communities when they're not in the room? 

### Lost Mothers series

Maternal harm and deaths in the US. About 800 women die each year in the U.S., about about 50,000 nearly die. 60 percent are preventable. Black mothers die at 3-4X the rate of white mothers. Last mandated to be reported in 2010.

Needed basic data: Name, cause of death or near death, date, states, prior births, type of delivery. Looked for conversations, but it's treated as private tragedy but not public health crisis. Crowdsourcing.

Spent two months developing the right form. Specific about intent (not interested in difficult pregnancies or births, for example). Questions changed based on conditional answers.

Three audiences: I almost died, I know someone who died, I know someone who almost died.

Majority were self-reported.

Had to be conscious of tone.

Did all this in tandem with traditional reporting.

Also searched out facebook groups — anything that touched maternal health at all.

Shared the form widely.

But then followed up. Constant communication, can't be just the form.

### Death behind bars

"The dataset that we used for this is not hugely robust." Telling the story beyond the data: this is a story about people. Data formed the basis for the story but wasn't the story.

Mostly vulnerable communities, so they don't have a voice or access and their stories were either overlooked or ridiculed.

Jail officials seemed sympathetic but didn't feel like they should be held accountable.

Family members became targets too.

Story started with anonymous tip: three suicides in the past month.

Requested 10 years of data for basic info, then requested more data points later.

Found big uptick after new sheriff, rate about 5x national average.

But had to figure out why. Found out only one death had been investigated by outside agency.

Use of video for explainers, interview and annotated raw video. 

Case studies/profiles.

Combating cynicism: Told human stories, described in detail, this could be you or someone you know, the data helped bolster the story.

Impact: Lots of calls, adovcated, law enforcement (for training purposes), sheriff changed policies and death rate fell.


### Data Journalism where everything is terrible

Corruption is not news. Inequality is not a story. Theft is not a story.

If we can count it, if we can measure it, we can fix it.

Process:

* Background
* Hypotheses
* Questions
* Analysis
* Story Structure
* Interviews
* Visualization
* Impact metrics

Start with headline story.

Background. Has someone else written this? Can we get to the bottom of this?

Hypotheses. Why is this happening? Tips: can be proven or disproven with data, specific about what's measured, is it measuring problem, causes, impact and solutions, is it important to the public? Common mistakes: too simple, too broad, too narrow, can't be proved, already is proven and common knolwedge.

Questions: Problem/Impact/Cause/Solution categories.

Impact: "News you can use". How can someone act on this info?

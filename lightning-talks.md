## Sensor Journalism in the Age of Trump‚Äôs EPA

[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z0AxXGX46xUk9208TB14H7OIjVfUrODR/view)

Proposed by: Kelly Calagna

With significant EPA budget cuts and program rollbacks set in place by the Trump administration, the role of environmental journalists has become vital in watching over the health of the public and the planet. In this talk, I will share the concept of a sensor project being developed by Northwestern University‚Äôs Knight Lab that will enable journalists and citizen scientists to collect high-definition air quality data that can be used to uncover at-risk populations.

### Notes:

Air pollution causes 1 in 9 deaths, mostly lung cancer.

Killing ourselves and our climate.

Administration is doing little to change it. Lowered standards and budget of EPA.

What can journalists and citizen scientists do to fill the gaps?

Sensor journalism. Can monitor pollutants, ozone, sound, etc.

SensorGrid. Democratize environmental data. Each node open source, open architecture, low-cost (under $200). Currently does particulate matter.

Not many sensors even in Chicago. Currently, algorithms calculate estimates.

## HELLO WORLD: How the English langauge failed international data journalism

[Slides](http://jonathansoma.com/projects/charsets/)

Proposed by: Jonathan Soma

Why do non-US and accented data sources tend to look like ‚ç∞‚ç∞‚ç∞‚ç∞? Let's take a trip into the magical land of √ßharacter encod√¨ng! Learn why Excel can't cope with the Champs-√âlys√©es, how emoji saved the planet, and how to say adi√≥s/„Åï„Çà„ÅÜ„Å™„Çâ/–¥–æ —Å–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–∏—è to these kinds of problems forever. üëã

### Notes:

Why your international data looks like garbage

Character encoding.

US-ASCII just has letters, numbers.

Latin-1 doubled it.

ISO-88591-SOMETHING

You open a file and it's a bunch of numbers. Your computer has to interpret. There's no way to know just going in.

Unicode 1.x - 16k characters, unicode 2.x - 1.1m

You can select different encodings in excel and most programming packages.

## Good Copy Editors Make Good Data Journalists

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_KlcTijrcHwQXVNwkPG072j7WboAvhtuB18H8_6UXSE/view#slide=id.p)

Proposed by: Justin Myers

Data journalists love to talk about precision. So do copy editors! I'll show you how thinking like a copy editor can help you find bugs, lock down your methodology and ensure your stories say exactly what you mean.

### Notes:

Enjoyed copyeding most.

It's not trendy but it's the truth.

Both about precision. Say what we mean and mean what we say.

"What do you mean by that?" in english and in code.

Last line of defense against doublespeak.

Punctuation.

Everything reflects some sort of editorial decision. Copyeditors excel at thinking about these decisions and their ramifications.

## We Need Multiple Career Paths for News Nerds

[Slides](https://medium.com/@mizzousundevil_7561/hi-my-name-is-matt-dempsey-and-im-the-data-editor-at-the-houston-chronicle-7891b509e0d7)

Proposed by: Matt Dempsey

Data journalists provide an essential role in modern newsrooms. We request, clean up and crunch data for stories big and small. We build interactive experiences and data visualizations for important projects. We're the hotness. But what does advancing in journalism look like if you have data skills? Few of us get to become editors. Why? Why does our news judgement mean less than those who come up as writers first? Why is the only career path for most over on the digital or tech side of things? I'll make an argument that just like with bylines, data journalists deserve a seat at the management table too.

### Notes:

Few of us are in leadership positions even though journalists are in huge demand. Either access or because we're not good candidates, but we're awesome so it's probably the access thing.

Had to argue for bylines. Fight for title of editor. Still doesn't oversee team of reporters.

"I was more respected when I was an intern."

30% of us feel our organizations don't value our work. 39% need editors who are qualified.

Who better to understand some of our challenges?

What can we do?

Help current leaders understand this is a problem.

Passionate people who want to take journalism to a higher level.

We need more of us in positions of power. And support each other.

Journalism needs us there.

## Immigrants working in the news industry

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NYcufcRDX6YPuK7e65gsFyo3uqfjio3Oh52YfVPJbvA/edit)

Proposed by: Kai Teoh

I want to talk about immigrants working in the industry, what the visa challenges they might face (that I've learned or experienced or am experiencing), and maybe focus a little on how others can be better supporters or allies to them.How "just get married" is really not a good suggestion, and can be really hurtful.How job departments and titles and classifications can matter a great deal more.How having a support network not just amongst peers, but also amongst supervisors/managers can mean the difference between being in the country or, well, not.

### Notes:

Why should you care? Immigrants are people too.

Common experiences: Job offers rescinded because they need a visa. Job in the product team but they have a degree in journalism. People have to leave the country because they missed a deadline.

How can we do better?

"Why don't you just get married?" That's kind of not the point.

"I'd harbor you!" Yeah, no.

If there's a union it can protect you.

If you're hiring, announce the policy. Don't want to go through the process of interviewing and find out later it doesn't work.

If you're a candidate, know the process.

Amplify our voice. When we talk about it it makes people uncomfortable.

## The news nerd guide to forming a union

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1azXdAK_RJVzSY2Lmxa3jycKXOoo5EOhkmucwE4KosNM/edit)

Proposed by: Jon Schleuss and Anthony Pesce

Data nerds Jon Schleuss and Anthony Pesce started the union at the L.A. Times. Learn how they relied on good data, used the company‚Äôs technology against it and organized the newsroom at a historically anti-union paper.

### Notes:

85% said "hell yes"

Reported on ourselves.

Data analysis on commutes, sent to publisher, published his response.

Technical issues: Getting a list of all the employees.

Protect your communication. The company was monitoring their comms.

Built a website. Just go with squarespace.

Logo.

Had to email whole newsroom. Company blocked access to listserv, had to figure out way around.

Predicted election.

And they won.

## Hope for the best, prepare for the worst

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xDJwf9Btpa4B8xCt--cBIa3xVItJSBpbRQYfa-qd76w/edit#slide=id.p)

Proposed by: Alexandra Kanik and Kate Howard

Part of publishing an investigation is anticipating how your audience will react, and being ready for it. But what about when the unexpected happens? In December 2017, we published a 5-part series about a state representative. In the middle of the roll out, he killed himself. We share what we learned about being prepared technologically, editorially, and emotionally for the unexpected.

### Notes:

The Pope's Long Con

It was going pretty well. We were getting a lot of attention and a lot of traffic. Then he killed himself.

We planned for a Kentucky audience. How to figure out how micro aws server could not crash. In the end I just had to go to bed and pray that the website would stay up.

Pjax ‚Äî single page application, limited requests to server. Assets split between 2 servers ‚Äî django on ec2 and media on s3.

Expected that rep might step down or not step down. Did not expect this.

But some of the conversations help them be prepared.

They'd done an extensive fact check. The story was right. Legal review.

Had additional reporters on hand to cover fallout (funeral, etc.).

Statement offered condolences but stood by story. Ignored trolls.

Brought in counselor and security. Editor gave them credit card (beers and lunches).

Make sure you're thinking about everyone on team, not just main writers. Keep doing journalism.

## I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not georeferenced! How we made a scrolly eclipse map with rubber bands, screenshots and math. (to be presented with Armand Emamdjomeh)

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nSzb-FjwmCFoI0lnPbiEH4F76xSUYw75TfyRJiTw4UA/edit?usp=sharing)

Proposed by: Denise Lu

No georeference? No problem. We had a what-if idea and put it together with nontraditional methods. What if you could scroll through the path of the Great American eclipse and look at it from a birds-eye view? ...What if it was one seamless image, from West Coast to East? ...What if you superimpose the umbra of the eclipse as you scrolled? ...What if the page could follow the eclipse in real time? The 30,000-pixel journey involves screenshots, rubber bands, some Photoshop and D3 magic and a lot of hacks, and was literally held together with Scotch tape at points.

### Notes:

Step 0: "Wouldn't it be cool if?"

1. Shaded relief
2. Raster land use
3. Tone in photoshop, export geotiffs
4. Import to google earth. (still georeferenced at this point)
5. Vector data
6. Screenshot time = rubber bands (Why? Easiest way)
7. Photoshop merge, then fix by hand
8. point of no return: Flatten.

Post-Flattening (P.F.)

Ai2HTML - 21 artboards!

Custom-fit vector data

3000+ labels added by hand

The Great American Eclipse Road Trip (GEART)

Needs a minimap.

Minimap, time and shadow shape all done using position on page.

Progressive image loading.

## Real Talk: Alcohol, Journalism and What I Did About It

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19aJGbKu6mjJBURtMUqe2fsKSuenfq8RKeEj_mmQ5icg/edit#slide=id.g34c155cfec_0_1)

Proposed by: Rachel Alexander

Journalism isn‚Äôt the healthiest industry for someone with eight alcoholics in her family. Using my experience as an addiction reporter and beer enthusiast, I'll talk about how I realized I was using alcohol in unhealthy ways, how I cut back and what you can do if you'd like to drink less while doing a stressful job.

I designed and built a dining room table; here's what it taught me about data.

### Notes:

We all have stressful jobs. What if we saw this as a problem instead of a fun quirky feature?

Not moralizing. Just be mindful. What if heavy drinking wasn't a default.

Why change? You might be drinking more than you think.

Used to think either you're an alcoholic or you're not. Turns out people are more complicated.

Federal guidelines: 7 drinks per week for women, 14 for men.

Geek out about it. Spreadsheet! Kind of like a reporting project.

Didn't make it easier. I miss not having to think about it. But a bunch of good stuff was happening too!

## I designed and built a dining room table; here‚Äôs what it taught me about data

[Slides](http://slides.com/stevenrich/woodendata#/)

Proposed by: Steven Rich

Working with wood is more like working with data than anything else I've ever done. It also taught me a lot I never would have considered otherwise. Allow me to be the Nick Offerman of data and impart my experience to you and I'll give you both a new perspective on data and a design for a functional extendable dining room table.

### Notes:

Expectation is almost never reality. Something will go wrong.

Don't start by building a table.

Design for humans first. Think about usability from the beginning.

There are a lot of ways to build a table.

Don't reinvent the wheel.

The type of join(t) matters. Butt joint = matching on names.

Measure twice, cut once.

Cut bigger and sand it down.

Perfect fits should scare you.

Fix problems as you see them.

Use the right tools.

You're going to get cut. Learn from it.

Don't stain good wood.

You need to think about what's missing.

No one is a master, the best never stop learning.

##### Description

Shotspotter? Federal Firearms Licenses? Trace data? We’ll help you sort out what data and documents you should routinely gather for reporting on guns, where you’re wasting your time and when it’s time to build from the ground up. We’ll cover common pitfalls and how to accurately cover the gun industry, firearm violence and regulatory agencies. You’ll leave with: sample data on guns, tips on finding sources and tips on reliable data streams.

## Notes

### Chicago Crime Lab

Kim Smith

Helps out all of Chicago

Gun trace report 2017

Fiiling in missing data:

ATF trace data: 1st retail sale.

Data on transfers: Ethnographics interviews; jail survey.

Recovered gun: Police admin data

Did prison/jail surveys of gun offenders.

How do prohibited possessors acquire guns?

Not gun shows, internet or theft, according to their data. Caveat: Only applies to person convicted; intermediaries may have.

Gun violence in Chicago 2016 report

"synthetic control" to figure out if gun violence interventions are working.

#### Shotspotter

Matt Drange

Know what the agency can see on its end: Wav files and location

Type,ID,Date,Time,Address,Round,CAD,Beat

PD might say shotspotter owns the data, but ownership may not affect what's public

#### FFLs: inspections, Tiahrt and revocation

Nick Penzenstadler

FFL lists available from ATF.

From FOIA: Inspection history, violations, narrative, corrective action. 10,000 inspections in 2011, 71 revocations.

Some FFLs get shut down, transfer their license, then reopen cleanly.

Tiahrt amendment means trace data is hard to get.

Background checks, NCIC and NICS

#### Online gun sales

Matt Drange

Building your own dataset.

Manually: Armslist or Facebook.

What's the scope of your universe? Zero in. Be transparent with the limits of your data.

"Sometimes getting a bunch of really bad examples is enough."

Know the jargon before you start collecting data. (Searching "AR-15" on ebay won't get you much, but searching the barrel diameter might)

#### Questions

Data sources on gun violence

**Kim Smith (KS):** CDC WISQARS is comprehensive. Non-fatal shootings hard to track over time.

Gun violence archive

Harrassed for joining gun groups on Facebook?

**Matt Drange (MD):** Yes.

Demographic info on gun ownership?

None, really.

What makes a gun illegal?

Someone having one who isn't supposed to. In Illinois, FOID Card is required.

The Trace made gun tracking data they collected available.

Gun buyback programs?

Not much data.

Spikes in gun sales after shootings?

May be available to county level. Probably only numbers though.

What public records are available?

Inspections of FFL. DOJ does it in California.

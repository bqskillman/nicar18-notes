##### Description

Panelists with a range of expertise will discuss the federal civil rights dataset, how to make the most of it and avoid the pitfalls. We also will talk about how to use state data to tell stories about disparities in schools. This session will provide lots of story ideas, so come with questions!

## Notes

### Alex Harwin

Data available for every school. What can you get from it? Special ed, arrests at schools, corporal punishment, teacher absences.

Data is messy but powerful. Impact: RI Govornor, White House Brief, other local and state level results.

How do you work with it? Look up comparisons at school and district level. Larger analyses are more complicated and require feedback loops and teamwork.

**Jennifer LaFleur (JLF):** Vetting, spot-checking this data is very important.

### Kameel

Working on [We Live Here](http://www.welivehere.show/). Tim Lloyd started the process by getting the data from DESE.

"When white kids act out they get kicked out of class, but the black kids get kicked out of school." Nut graf.

Johnny — 7 years old, out of school for 38 days in 1 year.

Data we got: Narrowed in on K-3 suspensions. Big difference between in-school suspensions (mostly given to white kids), out-of-school (mostly given to black students).

DIY data: surveys of resources, counselors, bias trainings.

Lessons: It had an impact. SLPS banned OSS for K-2, 20 other districts pledged to reduce or ban them. Different media, different approach: We created a database for people to look up their district.


### Tips

Where to get the data: Office for Civil Rights, NCES, state departments of education

Watch for data entry errors, look for impossible data, check against other datasets, verify with schools/districts if possible.

New data points are coming out.

## Questions

### How can this data effect change?

**Kameel Stanley (KS):** Data may not be the best way to effect change, but it can make some people pay attention.

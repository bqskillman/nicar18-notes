##### Description

Just when you had finally learned American FactFinder’s many foibles, the Census Bureau is shutting the site down. We’ll introduce you to its successor, data.census.gov, take you on a test drive and dish some tricks and secrets we’ve discovered. The new site will become the main source for census information in June.

## Notes

**Ally Burleson-Gibson (ABG):** How are we going to move to a single-search approach?

Want to replace FactFinder — it doesn't have all the data in it.

Data, software, access to API.

Ron Campbell

"Always read the footnotes."

How far back will we go (1970s)?

**ABG:** TBD.

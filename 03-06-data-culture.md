##### Description

How can news organizations create a sustainable culture for data and interactive journalism? In some cases, when one dynamic, charismatic CAR leader leaves for a new job, the data team left behind suffers and struggles to rebuild. Get practical advice and tips on ways to build a data culture in your newsroom that's sustainable and independent of any one staffer. How can data teams make a lasting impact on newsroom leadership and culture?

## Notes

How do we make sure we're not seen as expendable?

About 42% of reporters use data regularly, about half of organizations have someone doing data. But if there's someone who does do data, they're probably the only one.

Appetite for data training varies widely. Most people don't want to leave their newsrooms to learn.

Who uses data?

* Beat or projects reporters who learned skills on their own or through IRE
* Designated data reporter/editor (singular)
* Team of several journalists dedicated to data reporting/interactives/news apps

### If you're the only one, what can you do?

**Mark Nichols (MN):** Be the data evangelist. Invite yourself to meetings. Create usable in-house databases. Brown-bag lunches.

### How has support for data changed?

**MN:** There's more data available now. Journalists are interested in data earlier.

### What does the future look like? Is it necessary that we still have data reporters/editors, or will everyone be one?

**Annie Daniel (AD):** It's possible that will happen, reporters are getting more comfortable doing basic things. Allows people with data skills to do more interesting things.

**Tom Meagher (TM):** If there isn't someone with that title, it's easy to overlook it altogether. It isn't part of the day to day job for everyone yet.

Audience: What are our aspirations for what data journalism is? If it's just getting basic numbers from spreadsheets, sure. But maybe we can go past that.

**AW:** Reporters report on the data, we publish it.

### When it's viewed as a prestige team, how do we work better day to day? When someone leaves, who's responsible.

**MN:** Make the data seem important to reports and editors on every story. Editors are important in setting the culture.

**TM:** Make you colleagues' jobs easier.

**AD:** Hiring is important. Mentorship/intern programs. Let newer people bother you.

### Tools that fade away

**AD:** Two kinds of people, people who adapt and people who fix it. User testing. They may not want to bother you with "It's broken."

**MN:** Sometimes you have to be your own cheerleader.

**TM:** Envy can be a very powerful marketing tool.

### Fight for your byline

**AD:** Sometimes editors don't think about it; they're more in contact with the reporter. It probably isn't malicious. Consider writing a policy.

### What about double bylines on radio and broadcast? And distributed team? Pushing dealines.

**MN:** Editor helps. Show value of data to your story.

**TM:** Data isn't magic and editors need to understand what it can do and what its limitations are.

### How can you evolve

**AD:** At the end of the day we're reporters. Learning in public. Most of our job is calling people and asking really dumb questions.

### IRE/NICAR collective byline policy?

Good idea.

### How important is the title?

Title doesn't make you known.

##### Description

The Los Angeles Times' Map Maker was created and released to help journalists make locator and other maps faster. Whether it's a quick web locator map or a more detailed map of, say, all the rides at Disneyland, the Map Maker allows you to download both images and vector files to create better maps faster. Jon Schleuss from the Times will demo how to install, use and customize Map Maker for your newsroom.

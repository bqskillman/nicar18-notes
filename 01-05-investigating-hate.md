# Investigating hate when the data isn’t there (Diversity Track)

* Duaa Eldeib

##### Description 

How can we report on victims of bias-motived crimes when half of them don’t report the crimes to police, and when they do, police frequently fail to mark them down as such? Come listen to how we’ve done it (or tried to).

## Notes

No reliable stats exist. FBI says around 6,000 per year. Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates up to 250,000.

### Nadine

AJ+ Documenting Hate partnership put out a form and callout video. Used the database to find individual tips to create multimedia stories. Needed stories powerful enough to be told on social media.

### Duaa

Compare local data to state data to federal data. Hate crime convictions — there's no centralized database.

Drill down by location: college campuses, public transit.

Tweeted she was covering hate crimes and got stories. FOIAed police department to confirm.

Plea deals can drop hate crime charges.

Don't have to wait to do huge all-encompassing story. Chip away at it.

### Melissa

Build a reputation to be someone to approach with the stories.

The area isn't very racially diverse, which hinders reporting and recognition.

### Ken

Why America fails at collecting hate crime statistics.

FBI's master files are fixed-width and the dictionary is a typed, scanned document from the 90s.

Easy impact. Ask for records from local agency and see if they match up with FBI reports.

"Does this mean you've had no hate crimes, or that you don't track hate crimes reported to you?"

Ask how they handle hate crimes? Do they do hate crimes training? How do they handle racist graffiti — does it get marked as a hate crime?

## Questions

### Getting people to talk to you — "We saw this in the database, please talk to me"

**NS:** Sometimes trolls submit to the form. Have to fact check. Real people worry about being doxxed. Engagement team monitored comments.

**DE:** Fear. "Complaining witness not in court." "When they're contacted by a reporter, it's real."

**ML:** People feel like it's not worth reporting because it's happened to them a lot, they don't want to rehash it.

**DE:** Can't make them feel pressured. The power is in their hands.

### Tips to help people open up.

**DE:** Let them know you trust them. You're invested in this, not a story you'll check off your list and move on. Multiple interviews. Ask open ended questions. "Tell me in your words."

### How can we tell stories of people not like us?

**NS:** Understand your audience. Can collaborate with other newsrooms that have other audiences.

**DE:** Look for some kind of connection.

**ML:** How do you partner with with other orgs?

Rachel (propublica): Play to your strengths. If two newsrooms are interested in the same thing, matchmaking.

### How do you verify?

**NS:** Sometimes you have to go with your gut if there's no other way. Witnesses, police reports, etc.

**KS:** Police were skeptical. Talked to other members of LGBT community and they were skeptical. Tried to get court records.

### Dealing with distrust of media

**DE:** "But I'm here now, trying to tell this story."

**NS:** When they're reporting it, it's not usually the first time it's happened. This gives people a platform to realize this isn't normal.

### Outside of the US

**KS:** Not part of Documenting Hate project. Familiarity with laws helps.

### Other institutions you can benchmark reports against

**KS:** ADL, SPLC, other similar groups. Unifying that data is hard. Universities. Dept. of Education.

### LGBTQ incarceration and sexual assault while incarcerated; interview techniques to let people know you believe them but that you need more info

**DE:** Repeat the story in different ways. "For my publication…"

**NS:** Blame my editor for everything.

**KS:** Make a timeline, ask chronologically.

**ML:** ProPublica "Unbelievable Story of Rape" — reporter sent email, talked through lawyer first, no surprises. "You're always free to go." Only a couple people, minimal gear.

Audience: If you're FOIAing lots of police agencies and they say they don't have data, find corroboration in the news and send it to them.

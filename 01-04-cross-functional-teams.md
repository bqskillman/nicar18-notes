##### Summary

As more newsrooms adopt a product mindset, the culture clash between traditional editorial workflows and Agile development processes often comes to a head. Learn how tech-forward newsrooms are building cross-functional teams and the lessons they've learned along the way.

## Notes

**Joe Germuska (JG):** Attitude used to be "Think of them as the photo desk." But as technology has progressed, you can't wait until the end. Everybody has to feel like an equal player.

**Becca Aaronson (BA):** Everybody has different roles but you have to work together toward a common goal. How do we work efficiently but also collaboratively without stepping on each other's toes or running afoul of ethics issues?

**JG:** Recognize it's uncharted territory and no one knows exactly where we're going.

### Common conflicts, communication issues and cultural issues that arise.

**JG:** Software development mindset, strong specifications, does the code pass tests? Book: Difficult Conversations.

**BA:** Empathy is important. I may be making their job more difficult.

**JG:** Hard to build that on a service desk type environment.

### How to build trust?

**JG:** "Trench Warfare" helps. Consistent team routine. T-shirt: "Scrum Lunch Coffee". Not everyone has the bandwidth for that though. Make sure that people get together regularly. "Good occasions to get together that aren't about the work." The satisfaction of finishing something.

**BA:** Doing something where you communicate with someone outside your circle is work. 

**JG:** Post-mortems after a project, not a blame game.

**BA:** Good/Bad things. Recently added a "thankful" section.

## Questions

### Working with business side, marketing, etc.?

**BA:** Less of a clear divide. We all want to engage with the audience.

### Dealing with stepping on each others' toes?

**JG:** Looking at motivations, why are they doing that. Agree on principles. "These are our goals and our guiding principles."

**BA:** Approach with empathy and figure out why is something frustrating to them. Figure out how task has value for them, or at least realize you asking a favor of them.

Audience member: Conflict between shiny new thing and established code base. Have to compromise.

**BA:** Help accommodate different teams. It all connects back to larger goals.

### What questions should we ask of new managers?

**BA:** How do you manage conflict?

**JG:** Uncover their affinity for things we're talking about. Sometimes direct isn't best. Examples are good.

**BA:** How do you define success?

### Using markdown?

**BA:** Figure out how much technical savvy you're going to require of people. Figure out what the actual problem you're trying to solve is.


### Misc.

**BA:** Learn how to speak each others' languages.

### What to keep an eye out for when building a team?

**BA:** Create a consistent relationship, not just one-time.

**JG:** Or try it first before making a big committment, like a "ride-along".

**BA:** A medical-school match program, picking top candidates and mentors.

Audience member: Have reporters who miss their deadlines spend time on the copy desk.

### Synchronizing vocab/methodogies of developers and editorial

**BA:** Make your own language or find one that's in between. 

**JG:** Play games/run a simulation together.

### Editorial complaint that things are very rigid and formal

**BA:** Word template, they can edit the questions if they want but they have to see the original one. Follow up in person.
